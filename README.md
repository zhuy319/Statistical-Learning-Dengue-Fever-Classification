# Statistical-Learning-Dengue-Fever-Classification

## Project Description
Dengue fever is a challenging disease to diagnose, particularly for children in rural areas with limited access to advanced medical care. Therefore, this project aims to predict whether a child has dengue fever or not based on the given information on symptoms and children's personal information, and the data is about 5726 children from Vietnam who visited a clinic with symptoms of an illness and underwent tests for dengue fever.

The project consists of the following sections:

- **Section 1 Introduction and Data**: This section provides an overview of the project and performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- **Section 2 KNN**: In this section, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is explained and implemented on both an 80%-20% split and 10-fold cross-validation (CV).
- **Section 3 Logistic Regression**: This section focuses on using Logistic Regression using 10-fold CV to predict the presence of dengue fever in children.
- **Section 4 Discussion**: The final section of the project provides a comprehensive comparison of the results obtained from the KNN and Logistic Regression models. The logistic regression model is chosen due to its higher sensitivity compared to the KNN model.

## Technology Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:
- **R**: This project is written in R markdown and requires R to be installed on your system.
- **RStudio**: It is recommended to use RStudio as the development environment for running the R markdown file.
- **Required R packages**: Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed. The project code will include the package installation commands if any additional packages are required.
